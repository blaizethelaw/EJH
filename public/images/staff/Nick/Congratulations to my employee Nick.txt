Congratulations to my employee Nick Belfie on graduating from his 4 year plumbing apprenticeship through PHCC! Nick will now be a journeyman plumber! He completed 4 years of schooling and 8000 hours of on the job training! Going to school 2 nights a week for 3 hours after working all day is not easy! The hard work and dedication paid off! Proud to have had you apprentice under my master plumbers license and proud to have you working for my company! Time to do big things here!
